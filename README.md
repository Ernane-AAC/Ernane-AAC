I am an electrical engineer graduated from UFMG, Belo Horizonte Brazil, with a master's degree from UFSC, Florianópolis, Brazil and a doctorate from UFMG. I am a full professor at UFU, Uberlândia, Brazil, and I work with the Power Electronics group at this university. I develop researches in inverter parallel connection, frequency and voltage droop control, grid connected system, fuel cell power conditioning, PV systems and microgrids. This is a serious work where I use microcontrollers, but I like to develop other diverse applications with microcontrollers, such as electrical measurements, IOT control, interfaces for monitoring and supervising equipment through webpages.
